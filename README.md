# Final-Project--Allergy-and-Immunotherapy

The study describes the mathematical process of the immune system.
The research based on two mainly scientific studies. 
The first is "Mathematical Modelling of Allergy and Specific Immunotherapy:Th1-Th2-Treg Interactions", 
by Fridolin Groß, Gerhard Metzner and Ulrich Behn . The second one is "Modeling Immunotherapy for allergy", 
by Michael A. Fishman and Lee A. Segel.

In order to research the mathematical models in immunology, first I had to fully understand the mechanism of the immune system.
I had to understand all of its factors which are involved in the allergic response, and to understand how the process occurs.
Secondly, I decided to explore more than one approach in order to achieve better results. 
First, I've studied the Fishman's and Segel's study, and understood the mathematical model they researched about. 
Next, studied the Groß's, Metzner's and Behn's study[2] . Third, consulted with an allergist specialist in order to 
make sure my assumptions were correct.
Finally, by using MATLAB, programmed the model, and simulated different treatment doses. 
The goal of this study is to achieve a stable therapeutic process, by depressing the immune system response.
